ToDo:
1. Create and use interface for OrderManager
2. Create tests for COrder and COrderManager
3. Remove unnecessary things from COrder and COrderBase (especially from MT5 version)
4. Merge as much class as possible in MT4 and MT5 version, especially: AttachedOrder, AttachedOrderArray, Enums, MoneyManagement, OrderArray
5. Remove unnecessary things from COrderManager (like order selection)
6. Create order repository service, where the orders are stored instead of in OrderManager itself.
